   <h3>Place of Birth</h3>

   <p>Lena Taylor grew up in the era
    of Jim Crow and discrimination in the south. That motivated her to learn very 
    quickly, study hard and follow in her motherâ€™s footsteps, becoming a teacher. 
    Her life on the farm taught her values and skills that she still uses to this day. 
    Having siblings helped her build people skills that allow her to work well with 
    others personally and professionally. Graduating college from <a href="https://www.jsums.edu/">Jackson State University</a> and later moving up 
    north to pursue her career in teaching others. There she would find the love of 
    her life and start a family of her own.
