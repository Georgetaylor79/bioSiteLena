         <h3>Place of Birth</h3>

          of Jim Crow and discrimination in the south. That motivated her to learn very 
          quickly, study hard and follow in her mother’s footsteps, becoming a teacher. 
          Her life on the farm taught her values and skills that she still uses to this day. 
          Having siblings helped her build people skills that allow her to work well with 
          others personally and professionally. Graduating college from Jackson State University and later moving up 
          north to pursue her career in teaching others. There she would find the love of 
          her life and start a family of her own.</p><hr />
