           <p> Lena Taylor's Journey</p>
           <h3>Place of Birth</h3>
           <p>Lena Taylor grew up in the era
            of Jim Crow and discrimination in the south. That motivated her to learn very 
            quickly, study hard and follow in her motherâ€™s footsteps, becoming a teacher. 
            Her life on the farm taught her values and skills that she still uses to this day. 
            Having siblings helped her build people skills that allow her to work well with 
            others personally and professionally. Graduating college from Jackson State University and later moving up 
            north to pursue her career in teaching others. There she would find the love of 
            her life and start a family of her own.</p>

<p><b>"Growing up I always wanted to help others and seeing my mother as a positive role model was very important. I saw the hard work 
    she put in on the farm. Also, her educating others and being a teacher to other kids was something I knew I wanted to do."</b>
